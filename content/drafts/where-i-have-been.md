## Hola

Not that anyone was paying attention, but I finally escaped the grasp of inconsistency and sat down to *write*. Is not that I was not producing content/material, I was, just not for the blog.

## New Site

I put together a small "documentation" site which I'm using as my Digital Garden. [Forgetful Notes](https://forgetful.dev/) is a mix of my personal wiki and online notebook. You can find ideas at every stage of development.

## Unedited

A digital garden is a combination of an online notebook and a personal Wiki, where digital gardeners write in small, unfinished pieces, also known as atomic notes, and share these seeds of thought to be cultivated in public. Digital gardens are curated and evolve over time, sometimes growing wildly and sometimes getting pruned.

The phrase “digital garden” comes up often while browsing these notes. Surely I overuse it. That said, I still like it. It more closely describes what I envision this website to be: a carefully curated garden of digital notes. Having a reliable system on which to dump raw information is extremely useful. The idea of sweeping one’s mind is helpful to rid yourself of distractions from incorrectly prioritized tasks.

Networked thinking can happen at many levels. A digital garden is a scalable way to transform seeds of information into original work and to go from collector to creator. A place where little changes accumulate and transform thoughts and ideas. Continuous care in creating and maintaining a digital garden eventually yields fruits. (pun intended)

Gardens are explorable rather than structured as a strictly linear stream of posts. They grow slowly over time, rather than creating “finished” work that you never touch again. You revise, update, and change your ideas as they develop.
