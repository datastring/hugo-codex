# Apricity

> The warmth of the sun in winter.

Source code for my [blog](https://miguelpimentel.do/). Based on [Codex](https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex), a minimal blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Etymology

*Apricity* appears to have entered our language in 1623, when Henry Cockeram recorded (or possibly invented) it for his dictionary The English Dictionary; or, An Interpreter of Hard English Words. Despite the fact that it is a delightful word for a delightful thing it never quite caught on, and will not be found in any modern dictionary aside from the Oxford English Dictionary.
